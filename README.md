This project contains the source code for the architecturally-compliant coding and trade-off assignment.

The assignment instructions are given elsewhere.

The installation instructions are available in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

After installation the system can be accesed by a set of two user credentials:

| User ID | Password       |
|---------|----------------|
| user1   | ChaosMonkey@24 |
| user2   | OpenWebMath@77 |

The user who interacts with the system will first have to log into the system by entering these credentials when prompted on the screen, to access any of the other APIs.
